*Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.65+][msrv]*

[msrv]: #supported-rust-versions

## Supported Rust Versions

This fork follows the same minimum supported Rust version as the upstream `tracing-subscriber`.
The minimum supported version is 1.65. The current version is not guaranteed to build on Rust
versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

better-tracing follows a similar compiler support policy to the upstream project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with this policy.
