[changelog-url]: CHANGELOG.md

**better-tracing** = **tracing-subscriber** + **smart defaults and features that just work**

See the [CHANGELOG][changelog-url] for implemented features and fixes.

Utilities for implementing and composing [`tracing`][tracing] subscribers. This fork provides sensible defaults, accessible formatting, and resolves architectural limitations while maintaining full drop-in compatibility.

| Feature | better-tracing | tracing-subscriber |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Drop-in compatibility** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **External formatters access exiting span on EXIT/CLOSE** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| **Sane defaults with zero configuration** | ‚è≥ | ‚ùå |
| **Better builders** you don't have to fight with | ‚è≥ | ‚ùå |

## Fork Improvements

### Fixed Span Context for EXIT/CLOSE Events

In `tracing-subscriber`, `lookup_current()` returned the parent span instead of the exiting span during `FmtSpan::EXIT` and `FmtSpan::CLOSE` events. `better-tracing` fixes this.

```rust
use better_tracing::fmt::format::FmtSpan;

// Set up formatter with EXIT events
let subscriber = better_tracing::fmt()
    .with_span_events(FmtSpan::EXIT)
    .finish();

// Custom formatter that can now access the exiting span
use better_tracing::{
    fmt::{FmtContext, FormatEvent, FormatFields, format::Writer},
    registry::LookupSpan,
};
use tracing::{Event, Subscriber};
use std::fmt;

struct MyFormatter;

impl<S, N> FormatEvent<S, N> for MyFormatter
where
    S: Subscriber + for<'a> LookupSpan<'a>,
    N: for<'a> FormatFields<'a> + 'static,
{
    fn format_event(
        &self,
        ctx: &FmtContext<'_, S, N>,
        mut writer: Writer<'_>,
        event: &Event<'_>,
    ) -> fmt::Result {
        // Now returns the correct exiting span during EXIT/CLOSE events
        if let Some(span) = ctx.lookup_current() {
            write!(writer, "{}:", span.name())?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

*Compiler support: [requires `rustc` 1.65+][msrv]*

[msrv]: #supported-rust-versions

## Supported Rust Versions

This fork follows the same minimum supported Rust version as the upstream `tracing-subscriber`.
The minimum supported version is 1.65. The current version is not guaranteed to build on Rust
versions earlier than the minimum supported version.

better-tracing follows a similar compiler support policy to the upstream project. The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions before it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler version is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.66, three minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version is not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with this policy.
